# TopiaForge UGC World — Unity project template

A starter Unity project for authoring **UGC level content** for Robotopia and live-syncing it into the running
game with no restart. This is the TopiaForge equivalent of VRChat's `template-world`.

Create one from the launcher (**Developer → Projects → New ▾ → Unity world project**) or the CLI
(`topiaforge new unity-world <name>`). Both copy this template, install the
`io.github.furroxide.topiaforge.ugc-companion` package, register the project in the launcher's Projects list, and (where Unity is
detected) let you open it directly.

## What's inside

- `Assets/Scenes/Example.unity` — an empty starter scene. Build your level here.
- `Packages/vpm-manifest.json` — the VPM dependencies (the UGC companion + the resolver). The companion is
  installed for you. On a fresh clone, `io.github.furroxide.topiaforge.vpm-resolver` performs a bounded, read-only check and
  offers the explicit launcher/CLI recovery command; editor startup never downloads or extracts packages.
- `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` — the required Robotopia Unity version. "Open in Unity" launches only
  the matching installed editor.

## Fresh-clone package recovery

From the cloned project directory, restore packages before authoring:

```sh
topiaforge unity resolve .
```

You can also use **Developer → Packages → Resolve All** in the launcher. The CLI/launcher re-resolves the
declared ranges, verifies integrity for remote archives, validates package identity, stages replacements, and
rolls back on failure. Review the resulting `Packages/vpm-manifest.json` diff before committing it. The embedded
Unity recovery bridge only reports drift and can copy this command; it never mutates the project. Invalid or
oversized VPM manifests fail closed and are preserved for diagnosis.

## Author + go live (the workflow)

1. Open the project in the required Unity 6000.0.23f1 editor.
2. In `Example.unity`, create an empty GameObject named **UGC Root**. Build your level as children of it.
3. Tag GameObjects with UGC markers (Add Component → *UgcEntityMarker*, *UgcSpawnLocationMarker*,
   *UgcModelRenderer*, *UgcPoiMarker*, *UgcAgentMarker*, …) from the `io.github.furroxide.topiaforge.ugc-companion` package.
4. Open **TopiaForge → UGC Live Sync**, set the export root to **UGC Root** and a watch folder, then enable
   **Live Sync**. The scene exports to the watch folder on every save/change.
5. In the TopiaForge launcher's **UGC Live Sync** cockpit, point the watch folder at the same folder and hit
   **Go Live** — the running game hot-reloads your content. No manual scripts.

See `docs/UgcLiveSync.md` in the TopiaForge repo for the full contract (handedness, the export JSON shape, and
the Automerge channel for web-editor parity).

## Custom worlds (fully bespoke geometry — Blender welcome)

The UGC loop above places the game's **built-in** assets. To ship a **completely custom world**
(your own Blender/Unity geometry) as a playable Robotopia world:

1. Scaffold + pair (once):
   `topiaforge new mod my.world --template world` and
   `topiaforge new unity-world MyWorld --mod ..\my.world`
   (or pair this project with `topiaforge world link --project . --mod <modDir>` — writes
   `topiaforge.world.json`).
2. Author the world as **one prefab** at `Assets/World/World.prefab` — see `Assets/World/README.md`
   for the Blender→Unity crib sheet and the prefab contract (a `SpawnPoint` child, colliders, no
   custom scripts, optional HDRP Volume).
3. Build the bundle into the mod: **TopiaForge → Build World Bundle**, or `topiaforge world build`
   (headless; needs Unity 6000.0.23f1, the game player's editor version).
4. Play: `topiaforge world play` builds → packs → installs → launches; the world appears in the
   in-game GAMEMODES menu.

The current bundle target is `StandaloneWindows64`, so custom worlds run on the Windows player (native or
through Proton/Wine) but are not yet supported by the native macOS player.

The `io.github.furroxide.topiaforge.world-companion` package provides the build/validate menu items. Full walkthrough:
`docs/CustomWorlds.md` in the TopiaForge repo.
