# TopiaForge

TopiaForge is the umbrella toolkit for modding Robotopia: a runtime mod loader, a
standalone desktop launcher, and a developer CLI for the Unity Mono build of Robotopia.

## For players (installing & playing mods)

You need **no developer tools** -- no Flutter, Dart, .NET, or Node. Download the release zip for your OS:
`TopiaForge-windows-x64.zip`, `TopiaForge-macos-universal.zip`, or `TopiaForge-linux-x64.zip`. Windows and
Linux packages expose the launcher in `launcher/` and a root `topiaforge` CLI executable; macOS packages expose
`TopiaForge.app` plus a root `topiaforge` shim. The launcher detects your Robotopia installation, repairs the Windows
or macOS runtime payload, and lets you browse, install, enable/disable, and launch mods. The **Developer** tab is hidden by
default -- turn it on under **Settings -> Developer mode** only if you build mods.

Prerelease launchers check the signed beta channel by default after a persisted
cooldown. Updates are verified against embedded Ed25519 trust, downloaded and
extracted within signed bounds, and replace the complete package only after
explicit confirmation; a startup health handshake enables automatic rollback.
Unsupported layouts use the verified manual GitHub Releases download. See
[launcher updates](docs/LauncherUpdates.md).

The current compatibility target is Robotopia build **2309**. The built-in registry initially carries verified
first-party release artifacts only; community authors can use the documented self-hosted registry format while
official submission governance is being established.

Native macOS launcher/runtime packages are supported, but the current Unity-authored TopiaForgeUi brand bundle and
custom-world bundles target `StandaloneWindows64`. Custom worlds are therefore Windows/Proton-only for now;
on macOS, TopiaForgeUi falls through its documented font fallback chain if the brand bundle cannot load.

## For mod developers

Start with the walkthrough: [docs/YourFirstMod.md](docs/YourFirstMod.md). The release zip contains the
`topiaforge` CLI at its root — add it to `PATH` and you're set (see
[docs/Modding.md → Install the CLI](docs/Modding.md#install-the-cli)). Validate your machine first
(`topiaforge setup` to auto-fix what it safely can, or `topiaforge doctor` to audit read-only). Only the .NET SDK
is required to build mods; Node/Unity are optional (UGC live-sync). See [docs/Modding.md](docs/Modding.md) for
the full reference. Build branded in-game UI for Robotopia (windows, fullscreen tools, graph
editors, HUDs, modals, and toasts) with the TopiaForge UI kit — see
[docs/UiKit.md](docs/UiKit.md) and the F8 gallery mod. Add safe creator catalogs and reversible
sessions with [Creator Content](docs/CreatorTools.md). The complete first-party catalog and
candidate gameplay acceptance flows are in [docs/FirstPartyMods.md](docs/FirstPartyMods.md).

TopiaForge 1.0 remains standalone-only, while the stable multiplayer API preview lets authors opt a V5 mod into
generated server-canonical contracts, loopback play, and deterministic multi-peer tests before live
transport ships. V5 is also the normal standalone manifest when `multiplayer` is omitted; pre-release V4 was retired.
See
[docs/Multiplayer.md](docs/Multiplayer.md) and [docs/ManifestV5.md](docs/ManifestV5.md).

## Standalone launcher

The next-generation desktop launcher is in:

```powershell
apps\topiaforge_launcher_flutter
```

Run it locally with:

```powershell
cd apps\topiaforge_launcher_flutter
flutter run -d windows   # or -d macos / -d linux
```

The launcher uses Flutter with Bloc state management. It detects the known Robotopia installation, validates the Robotopia payload (`Robotopia.exe` on Windows/Proton, `Robotopia.app` on macOS), repairs bundled BepInEx and the C# loader, manages profiles, previews dependency/conflict plans before package installs, launches Robotopia, and creates diagnostic bundles.

Current launcher state management uses `Bloc<LauncherEvent, LauncherState>` rather than Cubit. Non-generated Dart source files are kept at 500 lines or fewer and split by responsibility.

## Developer workflow

TopiaForge has a Creator Companion style workflow with project manifests, lock files, package sources, restore, generated C# references, a `topiaforge` CLI, and a launcher Developer surface.

Contributors building the complete repository on Windows or macOS should run the cross-platform bootstrap first:

```powershell
pwsh ./tools/bootstrap-dev.ps1 -Verify
```

See [docs/ContributorSetup.md](docs/ContributorSetup.md) for prerequisites, the pinned Flutter SDK, managed
reference caching, and platform-specific build notes.

Start here:

```text
docs\CreatorCompanionParity.md
```

The workflow is inspired by VCC/VPM concepts and remains Robotopia-native: `.topiaforgemod` is still the runtime package format, while `topiaforge.project.json`, `topiaforge.lock.json`, and generated `topiaforge.dev.props` support source-controlled mod development.

## Local install

```sh
topiaforge dev-install                     # add --game-dir <path> to override Robotopia detection
```

(From a source checkout: `cd apps/topiaforge_cli && dart run topiaforge dev-install`.)

This installs BepInEx 5.4.23.5 and the manager plugin into the detected Robotopia installation:

| Platform | Built-in discovery |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tomato Cake\launcher\Robotopia`, plus Robotopia manifests in declared Steam libraries |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Tomato Cake/launcher` (the folder containing `Robotopia.app`; BepInEx installs beside the app), plus Robotopia manifests in declared Steam libraries |
| Linux | Robotopia manifests in Steam libraries declared by `libraryfolders.vdf`, including the Windows payload used by Proton |

Steam discovery requires an app manifest whose name and install directory are both exactly `Robotopia`; TopiaForge does not guess a Steam app id or recursively scan Wine/Proton prefixes. For another store or a custom prefix, pass `--game-dir` pointing at the Windows-layout Robotopia folder. On Linux, launch Robotopia with `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b"` so the mod loader injects. The `ROBOTOPIA_GAME_DIR` environment variable overrides automatic detection on every platform.

Launch Robotopia, then open the manager from the main-menu **TopiaForge** button or press `F10`.

## Package format

Mods are `.topiaforgemod` zip files with a required `topiaforge.mod.json` manifest and a C# entry class that derives from `TopiaForge.Mods.TopiaForgeMod`.

Scaffold a mod and pack it:

```sh
topiaforge new mod yourname.firstmod --name "First Mod" --author "Your Name" --license AGPL-3.0-or-later
cd yourname.firstmod
topiaforge pack
```

`topiaforge pack --all` packs the non-DevTool first-party mods under `mods/`; add
`--include-dev-mods` to include Creator Tools and UiGallery. Release packaging adds Creator Tools
explicitly while keeping UiGallery out of the player payload. `topiaforge unity pack-packages`
regenerates the VPM listing in `dist/vpm/`.

Packages can be installed from the Robotopia manager's package tab by full path, or by placing them into:

```text
BepInEx\TopiaForge\package-inbox
```

## Trust model

TopiaForge uses trusted local packages. Do not install `.topiaforgemod` files unless you trust their source; C# mods execute code in the Robotopia process.

## License

The SDK packages are covered by the same terms with no linking exception, so a mod distributed
against the TopiaForge SDK must also be licensed `AGPL-3.0-or-later`. Third-party materials keep
their original licenses; see [THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). Contributions are
accepted under the same terms with a [DCO 1.1](DCO) sign-off.
