# Initial release blocker register

Last audited: 2026-07-14. Product candidate: `0.1.1`. Recommendation: **NO-SHIP**.

The repository-wide remediation found no remaining known local critical- or high-severity engineering defect. The
release is nevertheless blocked by decisions, credentials, protected-host configuration, and native/in-game
acceptance that cannot be supplied by source changes. The strict publication gates intentionally continue to reject
the candidate until those items are closed.

This register applies to the exact working tree audited on the date above. It does not attest a future commit. Close
an item only with evidence from the frozen candidate SHA; do not treat an unavailable host, credential, or human
review as a waived check. The repeatable procedure is in [`ReleaseChecklist.md`](ReleaseChecklist.md), and the full
component/contract map is in [`ArchitectureInventory.md`](ArchitectureInventory.md).

Priority meanings:

- **P0** — required before any public release.
- **P1** — required before general availability unless the owner records an explicit, dated, scope-limited
  disposition.
- **P2** — a conditional future gate; it is not a v1 blocker while the stated conservative constraint remains true.

## Verification matrix

`PASS` means the locally applicable gate passed on this working tree. `FAIL` is an expected hard-stop that correctly
rejected a non-distributable candidate. `BLOCKED` requires authority, credentials, hardware, hosted configuration, or
manual evidence unavailable to this audit. No required check is silently skipped.

| Gate family | Result | Retained evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Whole-repository component and contract inventory | PASS | All source, app, package, mod, template, tool, schema, test, documentation, and workflow surfaces are mapped in `ArchitectureInventory.md`. |
| C# Release solution | PASS | 20 projects; zero build warnings or errors on SDK `10.0.301` / runtime `10.0.9`. |
| C# regression harness | PASS | Complete `TopiaForge.ModManager.Tests` harness passed. |
| C# boundaries and public SDK surface | PASS | Unity-free Core, Unity/BepInEx runtime isolation, strict audit, generated API baseline, and bounded production-read scans passed. |
| Dart formatting and analyzers | PASS | 254 Dart files checked; domain, data, UI, app, and CLI analyzers report no issues. |
| Dart domain/data tests | PASS | 147 domain and 187 data tests passed. |
| Flutter UI/app tests | PASS | 2 shared-UI and 46 launcher tests passed, including BLoC lifecycle, scaling, contrast, focus, install confirmation, safe mode, recovery, and Xcode payload/logging configuration. |
| CLI tests | PASS | 126 tests passed, including packaging, registry, Unity probing, UGC, release metadata, final-archive validation, ad-hoc/Developer ID signing separation, and fail-closed signing behavior. |
| C#/Dart contract parity | PASS | SemVer 2.0, build mapping, canonical fields, unknown fields, dependencies, pins, conflicts, load order, and state fixtures agree. |
| Sidecar install/runtime/security | PASS | Lockfile `npm ci`, syntax checks, 16 tests, production dependency tree, and audit passed with zero vulnerabilities. |
| Archive, UGC, diagnostic, repair, and process hardening | PASS | Adversarial traversal/link/collision/size/race/rollback/redaction/timeout regressions passed. |
| First-party mods | PASS | All 13 mods validated and packed twice byte-identically; archives were inspected directly. UiGallery is excluded from the normal player payload. |
| C# author templates | PASS | All seven template families scaffolded, validated, packed twice, and inspected; defaults remain deliberately non-publishable. |
| VPM and canonical ecosystem payload | PASS | Three VPM packages and the 12-mod player payload built twice byte-identically with no missing, extra, linked, or mismatched entries. |
| Exact-Unity TopiaForgeUi build | PASS | Unity `6000.0.23f1`; two builds matched SHA-256 `3cc6624f2a3a5fabc83c4fde49b32f859869e1d1e202afdaf91a888089f9fedb`. |
| Exact-Unity representative world build | PASS | Two builds matched SHA-256 `f6e6a9802eb043eb5b81d3d519eead7cbb47f348d4c1d110747ec73378464bc9`. |
| Exact-Unity lifecycle smoke | PASS | Sixteen repeated create/dispose and scene-transition cycles returned allocator, tween, cursor, hotkey, modal, theme, and callback state to baseline. |
| Game compatibility | PASS | Build `2227`; 217 bindings, 195 statically verifiable, 22 explicitly dynamic/in-game-only, zero indeterminate findings. |
| Public build freshness | PASS | Both audited platform records still identify build `2227`; CI/release now fail if the public latest manifest changes. |
| BepInEx/UnityDoorstop provenance | PASS | Pinned BepInEx `5.4.23.5` archives and extracted trees, UnityDoorstop commit/source, hashes, modes, and notices validate. |
| Local macOS package structure | PASS | Universal launcher/frameworks and GameCompat, separate runnable arm64/x64 Dart AOT CLIs, canonical nested payload bytes, modes, links, notices, and deterministic archive bytes validated. |
| Local macOS launch and Xcode development | PASS | Fresh Xcode Debug/Release code shares Team ID `34Y7669588`; the shared scheme resolves checkout payloads. A regenerated 12-mod/BepInEx technical archive passed structural, embedded-CLI, and direct five-second launch smoke after ad-hoc signing correctly omitted hardened runtime. |
| Local macOS runtime repair | PASS | The installed build-2227 copy transactionally repaired BepInEx `5.4.23.5` and loader `0.2.0`, restored executable modes, left no transaction residue or managed links, and staged all 13 first-party packages. Package-inbox ingestion remains part of authorized in-game acceptance. |
| Release-policy/BOM/SBOM/checksum machinery | PASS | Policy validation in technical dry-run mode and metadata build/verify regression suites passed. |
| Repository and CI hygiene | PASS | actionlint, PSScriptAnalyzer, PowerShell/bash syntax, shellcheck, JSON, YAML, schemas, Markdown links, LFS, action pins, conflict markers, LF policy, and Dart line cap passed. |
| Credential exposure containment | BLOCKED | An Xcode scheme pre-action printed inherited credential-shaped variables during this local audit. Repository shell phases now suppress environment listings, release children scrub secret-shaped names, and contributor guidance requires a sanitized Xcode launch; affected credentials still require owner rotation and local-log disposal. See `P0-CRED-01`. |
| Strict distributable-release policy | FAIL | Correctly stops on `OWNER_DECISION_REQUIRED`, `NOASSERTION`, and blocked release status; see `P0-LIC-01`. |
| Production macOS trust | FAIL | Structural/ad-hoc validation passes, but Developer ID team identity, notarization, stapling, and Gatekeeper correctly fail; see `P0-MAC-01`. |
| Windows x64 signed package and clean-host run | BLOCKED | Requires a Windows runner, Authenticode identity, RFC 3161 timestamp service, and clean-machine QA; see `P0-WIN-01`. |
| Linux x64 package and Proton run | BLOCKED | Flutter desktop builds are host-specific; requires Linux/Proton runners and gameplay QA; see `P0-LINUX-01`. |
| Signed macOS arm64 and Intel clean-host runs | BLOCKED | Requires Apple credentials and quarantined clean hosts; see `P0-MAC-01`. |
| Authorized build-2227 in-game acceptance | BLOCKED | Dynamic bindings, all mods, reloads, recovery, and profiler evidence require an authorized game environment; see `P0-GAME-01`. |
| Native UX/accessibility acceptance | BLOCKED | Screen Recording permission prevented screenshot comparison; screen-reader and native-platform manual QA remain; see `P1-UX-01`. |
| Project license, IP, and OSS legal approval | BLOCKED | Project-owner/legal decisions cannot be inferred; see `P0-LIC-01`, `P0-IP-01`, and `P0-OSS-01`. |
| Privacy/backend authorization and package trust policy | BLOCKED | Remote features default off, but owner approval is still required; see `P0-PRIV-01` and `P0-TRUST-01`. |
| GitHub rulesets, environments, secrets, tag, and attestations | BLOCKED | Repository administration and credential owners must configure and prove the trusted path; see `P0-HOST-01`. |
| Frozen candidate hosted matrix and reviewed release record | BLOCKED | This audit intentionally leaves uncommitted changes and creates no tag/release; see `P0-CAND-01`. |
| Independent player/author clean-machine acceptance | BLOCKED | Requires external participants and supported native hosts; see `P1-E2E-01`. |

Matrix totals: **25 PASS, 2 FAIL, 11 BLOCKED, 0 SKIP**.

The four informational exceptions are explained, not waived: `dotnet format` reports expected workspace-loader
diagnostics for the intentional Unity compile/reference split while formatting 0 of 420 files; Flutter reports newer
packages outside current compatible constraints; Node lists optional non-host native packages; and 22 GameCompat
bindings are inherently dynamic and therefore belong to the in-game acceptance gate.

## P0 blockers

- [ ] **P0-LIC-01 — Approve the project/inbound license and replace the release sentinel.**

  Owner: project owner and legal counsel.

  Current state: `release/release-policy.json` deliberately contains `OWNER_DECISION_REQUIRED`; first-party
  manifests use SPDX-standard `NOASSERTION`; default scaffolds contain a no-grant notice. Local validation is useful,
  but publication validation fails by design.

  Exit criteria: identify copyright holders and inbound contribution terms; approve an outbound SPDX expression;
  add the canonical root license; update all first-party manifests/packages; confirm which independently distributed
  artifacts must carry which text; run the strict policy, package, registry, BOM, SBOM, and archive-notice gates with
  zero findings.

- [ ] **P0-IP-01 — Approve the rights basis and public naming for game integration and assets.**

  Owner: project/game owner and IP/trademark counsel.

  Exit criteria: retain written authority or an approved clean-room/non-affiliation basis for the Robotopia and
  TopiaForge names, game injection, compatibility extraction/baselines, registry claims, web-derived art, adapted
  icons, fonts, and custom-world content. Remove or replace any item that lacks a distributable rights basis and
  record provenance, transformation, hash, license, and approver for retained assets.

- [ ] **P0-OSS-01 — Obtain legal acceptance of the completed third-party disposition.**

  Owner: open-source compliance/legal and release engineering.

  Current state: BepInEx, Harmony, MonoMod, Cecil, UnityDoorstop, .NET, MetadataLoadContext, Flutter/Dart, SPDX data,
  and font provenance/notices are mechanically verified. UnityDoorstop corresponding source and neutral renamed TMP
  derivatives are bundled.

  Exit criteria: legal review confirms the LGPL corresponding-source method, OFL derivative/font treatment, notice
  placement, and license compatibility for the exact final BOM/SBOM bytes.

- [ ] **P0-PRIV-01 — Approve remote AI, player-token, microphone, and speech-to-text behavior.**

  Owner: backend/game owner, privacy/legal, security, and product.

  Current state: canonical descriptive capabilities are present; `remote-ai` is the sole remote-inference label; Zombies live-brain
  and voice defaults are off; no token, remote-AI, microphone, or STT activity occurs without explicit configuration.

  Exit criteria: authorize the backend use; document destination, purpose, authentication, consent, cost, retention,
  deletion, abuse/rate limits, transcript/history handling, incident response, and jurisdictional requirements; review
  launcher disclosures; test signed-out, denied, offline, rate-limited, timeout, cancellation, and revocation paths.

- [ ] **P0-TRUST-01 — Approve the package trust and first-party publication model.**

  Owner: security, product, registry, and release owners.

  Current state: the launcher discloses source, digest, aggregate capabilities, and arbitrary-code risk. Permissions
  are explicitly descriptive, not a sandbox. Official community submissions/deployment are closed; self-hosted
  registries remain supported.

  Exit criteria: approve how first-party keys/digests and download origins are trusted, how a compromised package is
  revoked, how installed users are warned/recovered, and who may authorize an official payload. Do not market
  capability declarations as containment.

- [ ] **P0-MAC-01 — Produce a Developer ID-signed, notarized final macOS archive.**

  Owner: macOS signing owner and release QA.

  Exit criteria: sign every nested Mach-O with the approved Developer ID/Team ID and hardened runtime; notarize and
  staple the app; extract the final ZIP with quarantine metadata; pass deep/strict codesign, expected team identity,
  `stapler validate`, and Gatekeeper on clean Apple Silicon and Intel hosts; run install, repair, launch, diagnostics,
  and uninstall. Never weaken library validation or omit hardened runtime in a public candidate. An explicitly
  non-distributable ad-hoc technical dry run may omit hardened runtime, and publication must continue to reject it.

- [ ] **P0-WIN-01 — Produce and validate the signed Windows x64 archive.**

  Owner: Windows signing owner and release QA.

  Exit criteria: build from the frozen SHA on Windows; Authenticode-sign every required executable with SHA-256 and
  an HTTPS RFC 3161 timestamp; run `signtool verify /pa /all /tw` against the final extracted ZIP; inspect hashes,
  links, modes/notices, and runtime assets; exercise clean install/repair/profile/safe-mode/failure/diagnostics/update
  and uninstall journeys.

- [ ] **P0-LINUX-01 — Produce and validate Linux x64 and Proton behavior.**

  Owner: Linux/Proton release QA.

  Exit criteria: build on Linux from the frozen SHA; inspect final ZIP executable modes, links, checksums, notices,
  and bundled payloads; run native launcher/CLI flows; exercise the documented Windows-game-under-Proton discovery,
  path translation, process launch, runtime repair, custom-world, recovery, and uninstall paths.

- [ ] **P0-GAME-01 — Complete authorized build-2227 runtime and first-party-mod acceptance.**

  Owner: runtime/mod QA with authorized game access.

  Exit criteria: on build `2227`, test startup/shutdown, repeated scenes, safe mode, reloads, enable/disable,
  dependency order, package inbox, collision isolation, partial failures, restart-required state, save compatibility,
  all 13 mod flows, TopiaForgeUi-only UI, dirty updates, and resource teardown. Verify all 22 dynamic GameCompat bindings and
  record profiler evidence of no steady-state allocation regressions or task/callback leaks.

- [ ] **P0-HOST-01 — Configure and prove the protected hosted release path.**

  Owner: GitHub administrator, security, and credential owners.

  Exit criteria: configure required aggregate contexts (`Required / CI validation`, `Required / Release packages`,
  `Required / Registry validation`, and trusted-candidate `Required / Unity validation`); protect release and Unity
  environments with reviewers; inventory and scope Apple, Windows, Unity, managed-reference, Pages, and attestation
  credentials; prove fork PRs are secretless; enable reviewed Pages and immutable-release policy; protect creation of
  the annotated `v0.1.1` tag while forbidding mutation/deletion; retain an administrator-reviewed dry run.

- [ ] **P0-CRED-01 — Rotate credentials exposed through the local Xcode build log.**

  Owner: credential owners and security.

  Current state: an audit build inherited credential-shaped API/GitHub variables from its parent application, and
  Xcode's required Flutter scheme pre-action included them in its local build log. No value was written to tracked
  repository files. Repository-owned PBX shell phases now disable environment logging, release child processes strip
  explicit and secret-shaped variables, and contributor documentation requires reopening Xcode from a sanitized
  context. Xcode's scheme pre-action logging itself cannot be disabled by the repository while that prepare action is
  required.

  Exit criteria: revoke and rotate every credential present in the affected audit/Xcode log; remove the affected
  local DerivedData and task logs under the applicable retention policy; confirm the old credentials no longer work;
  review hosted secrets for least privilege; and retain a sentinel build proving a sanitized Xcode launch does not
  expose credentials.

- [ ] **P0-CAND-01 — Freeze and attest one candidate SHA.**

  Owner: release manager.

  Exit criteria: review and commit the remediation; approve release notes; create the pre-protected annotated
  `v0.1.1` tag on that exact SHA through the authorized process; run every hosted/native/Unity gate without unexplained
  warnings or skips; generate and independently verify the candidate BOM, SPDX SBOM, `SHA256SUMS`, nested digests,
  sizes, signatures, provenance, and manual-release index. The workflow may prepare only a matching draft and must
  never create/mutate the tag, replace assets, or publish automatically.

## P1 acceptance gates

- [ ] **P1-UX-01 — Complete native visual and accessibility acceptance.**

  Owner: product/accessibility QA.

  Exit criteria: capture and review Home, Setup, Mods, Browse, Profiles, Diagnostics, Settings, and Developer flows on
  every supported native host at 800x600 and larger; cover empty/loading/warning/error/destructive/recovery states,
  keyboard-only navigation, focus restoration, 100–200% text scaling, high contrast, reduced motion, screen readers,
  long paths, and no-overflow behavior. Local automated coverage is green, but macOS denied Screen Recording to this
  audit, so screenshot comparison was not fabricated.

- [ ] **P1-E2E-01 — Run independent clean-machine player and author journeys.**

  Owner: release/community QA.

  Exit criteria: a player discovers the game, installs/repairs BepInEx, installs the canonical package set, previews
  capabilities/dependencies, launches normally and in safe mode, diagnoses a failure, updates manually, and recovers.
  Separately, a new author uses only published docs to install prerequisites, scaffold with explicit author/license,
  build/test/package/validate, publish to a self-hosted registry, install through the launcher, diagnose, and update.

- [ ] **P1-SUPPORT-01 — Name public support and incident owners.**

  Owner: project/community/security owners.

  Exit criteria: approve monitored security and support contacts, response expectations, vulnerability intake,
  takedown/escalation path, compatibility/deprecation promise, release-note owner, and launch/on-call coverage. Replace
  placeholder destinations in public documents before publication.

## P2 conditional gates and frozen v1 scope

- [x] **P2-UPDATE-01 — Launcher upgrades are manual-only.** `manual-releases.json` format 2 carries only HTTPS URLs,
  hashes, sizes, and `manualOnly: true`; no replacement strategy is advertised. A future automatic updater requires a
  separate signed-metadata, bounded-extraction, rollback, and recovery review.
- [x] **P2-REGISTRY-01 — Official community submissions remain closed.** Official indexes contain first-party entries
  only. Opening submissions requires namespace ownership, moderation, malware review, transfer/dispute, yank,
  revocation, appeal, and installed-user response governance plus tests.
- [x] **P2-WORLDS-01 — Custom worlds are Windows/Proton-only for v1.** Do not advertise native macOS game support.
- [x] **P2-COMPAT-01 — Build `2227` is the sole supported game build.** Numeric build `N` maps to SemVer `0.0.N`.
  Any change in the public latest manifest stops release for a new compatibility audit; unknown constrained versions
  block mods but never block an empty safe-mode launch.

## Ship decision

**NO-SHIP.** Local remediation is release-credible, but the strict policy and production trust gates correctly fail,
and all P0/P1 evidence above must be tied to a frozen candidate. The recommendation may change only after every P0 is
closed, each P1 is closed or receives an explicit dated disposition, the final matrix is rerun against the candidate
SHA, and no new critical/high finding or unexplained warning remains.
