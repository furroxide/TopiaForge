# TopiaForge Creator Companion (VCC-parity guide)

The TopiaForge launcher's **Developer** tab is a Creator-Companion-style cockpit for building content for
Robotopia — the equivalent of VRChat's Creator Companion (VCC). It manages multiple projects, detects Unity,
installs/restores VPM packages, scaffolds new projects/packages from templates, and drives UGC live-sync into the
running game. Everything is also available from the `topiaforge` CLI.

Enable it in **Settings → Developer mode** (off by default; consumers never see it).

## Projects (multi-project management)

The **Projects** pane lists every tracked project (persisted to `developer_projects.json` in the launcher data
root — VCC's project list). Each card shows the name, a kind badge (Mod / Unity world / Unity package), the Unity
version, and the path.

- **New mod…** — scaffolds a C# mod project (`topiaforge.project.json` + a starter mod), optionally with a Unity
  companion.
- **New Unity world…** — copies the [Unity world template](#templates) and installs the UGC companion (see
  [create-from-template](#create-from-template)).
- **Add existing…** — registers any project folder; the kind is sniffed from its files (`topiaforge.project.json`
  → mod; `Packages/vpm-manifest.json` → Unity world; `package.json` → Unity package).
- **Manage** — loads the project into the per-project panes below. Mod projects get the lifecycle panes (Resolve /
  Pack / Install / Doctor); Unity projects get the [Packages](UnityVpm.md) pane.
- **Open in Unity** — launches only the TopiaForge Unity authoring editor pinned in
  `ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt` (`6000.0.23f1`). Detect-only: install Unity via Unity Hub yourself.
- **Remove** — untracks (never deletes files).

CLI: `topiaforge projects list|add [path]|remove <path>|open [path]`.

## Unity detection

The launcher discovers installed Unity editors via Unity Hub (Windows: `%PROGRAMFILES%\Unity\Hub\Editor\*` plus
the Hub's secondary install path, and `UNITY_EDITOR_PATH`), newest first. This is **detect + open only** — the
launcher never downloads or installs Unity.

## Templates

- **Mod templates** (`templates/mod/<id>/`) — seven directory templates for C# mods (`minimal`, `gameplay`,
  `gamemode`, `service`, `ui`, `asset`, `world`), each with a `template.json` (metadata + manifest defaults) and
  `{{TOKEN}}`-substituted sources. Scaffold with `topiaforge new mod <id> --template <id>`; list them with
  `topiaforge list templates`. See [Modding.md](Modding.md#scaffolding-and-manifest-management-from-the-cli).
- **Unity world** (`templates/TopiaForge.UnityWorldTemplate/`) — a starter Unity project for authoring UGC levels:
  a sample scene, `Packages/manifest.json` + `Packages/vpm-manifest.json` (UGC companion + the embedded
  resolver), a VCC-style `Packages/.gitignore`, and a pinned Unity 6 version. The `template-world` analog.
- **Unity package** (`templates/TopiaForge.UnityPackageTemplate/`) — a starter VPM package (Runtime/Editor asmdefs
  + `Samples~`). The `template-package` analog. Scaffold one with `topiaforge unity new-package <id>`.

### Create-from-template

Creating a Unity world project copies the template, restores the `io.github.furroxide.topiaforge.ugc-companion` package into
`Packages/` through the launcher/CLI security boundary, and registers the project — the same
instantiate-then-resolve flow VCC uses. Repository subscriptions remain launcher data; scaffolding does not
write a machine-local repository path into the project. The embedded recovery bridge only detects package drift
and offers the explicit resolve command; it never performs network or archive work during Unity startup.

CLI: `topiaforge new unity-world <name> [--dir path] [--live-sync [--watch folder]]`. For the full one-command
authoring loop (create/resolve the project, seed the companion, deploy the game config, and launch Unity
connected) use `topiaforge ugc dev` — see [UgcLiveSync.md](UgcLiveSync.md#cli-ugc-setup-and-ugc-dev-one-command-authoring-loop).

## Packages (VPM)

The **Packages** pane (shown when managing a Unity project) lists installed/resolved packages, available packages
to add, **Resolve All**, and subscribed repositories. See [UnityVpm.md](UnityVpm.md) for the package/manifest/
listing formats, the resolver, and the `topiaforge unity …` CLI.

## UGC Live Sync cockpit

The **UGC Live Sync** pane (see [UgcLiveSync.md](UgcLiveSync.md)) auto-detects connection values, shows live
diagnostics from the game, and offers a one-button **Go Live** that runs the whole pipeline with no manual
scripts.
