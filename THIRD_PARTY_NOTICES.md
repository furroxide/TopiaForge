TopiaForge launcher UI bundles first-party Robotopia web brand assets from `https://robotopia.gg/` and local
TopiaForge brand derivatives for offline launcher theming.

- Web-derived raster files: `topiaforge-city-header.webp`, `baby-stitch.webp`, `robot.webp`, and `sheriff.webp`

  app-icon variants under `apps/topiaforge_launcher_flutter`
- Source: `https://robotopia.gg/`
- Local changes: filenames were normalized; the TopiaForge logo, mark, and platform icon variants were
  adapted for launcher packaging.

The standalone `topiaforge` executable embeds the Dart SDK runtime and the following runtime packages. Release
packaging copies the exact license texts resolved by `apps/topiaforge_cli/.dart_tool/package_config.json` into
`third_party/dart/LICENSES`, together with `VERSIONS.json`; package validation fails if any text is absent.

The Flutter 3.41.4 launcher embeds Flutter, Dart, plugins, and package dependencies. Flutter generates the complete
`flutter_assets/NOTICES.Z` notice bundle during each platform build; release validation requires that bundle inside
the shipped launcher.

The self-contained `TopiaForge.GameCompat.Extractor` embeds .NET Runtime 10.0.9. Packaging copies `LICENSE.TXT` and
`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT` from the exact restored `Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.<rid>/10.0.9` runtime pack into
`third_party/dotnet`; validation fails if the runtime version marker or either notice is absent. Public runners pin
.NET SDK 10.0.301 so the runtime pack and its notices cannot drift between release runs.

The extractor also embeds `System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext` 10.0.9. That NuGet package declares MIT in its
signed `.nuspec` and ships `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT`, but it does not contain a separate `LICENSE.TXT`. Packaging
verifies the exact MIT declaration and copies the identical .NET Foundation MIT text from the pinned runtime pack as
the MetadataLoadContext license, together with the package's exact third-party notices; all are mandatory inputs.

The CLI's publication gate includes a generated identifier allowlist from SPDX License List Data 3.28.0.
