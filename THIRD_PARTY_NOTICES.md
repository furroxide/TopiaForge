RoboPatch was used only as behavior prior art for clean-room compatibility planning. No RoboPatch code was copied or ported.

Prism Launcher was used only as product maturity and UX inspiration. No Prism Launcher code was copied or ported.

TopiaForge launcher UI bundles Robotopia web brand assets from `https://robotopia.gg/` and local
TopiaForge artwork for offline launcher theming.

- Web-derived raster files: `topiaforge-city-header.webp`, `baby-stitch.webp`, and `sheriff.webp`
- Source: `https://robotopia.gg/`
- Rights basis: **unresolved.** These files originate from Robotopia's own web brand assets and no
  redistribution licence has been identified. Permission has been requested from Tomato Cake. Until a
  written grant is recorded here, these three files have no distributable rights basis and block
  `P0-IP-01`. If permission is declined or not received, they must be removed or replaced.
- Local changes: filenames were normalized for launcher packaging.

The TopiaForge pixel-art wordmark, icon, generated platform icon variants, and the drawn pixel-art robot
in `packages/launcher_ui/lib/src/pixel_robot.dart` are first-party project assets, not Robotopia-derived
third-party artwork. The robot replaced a previously bundled `robot.webp` taken from the Robotopia web
bundle; it is defined as a checked-in pixel grid rather than a raster file so its provenance is
unambiguous.

TopiaForge bundles the Quicksand font for body typography in the launcher UI and Unity brand bundle.

- Project: Quicksand
- Source file: `https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/quicksand/Quicksand%5Bwght%5D.ttf`
- Upstream: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1
- Bundled at: `packages/launcher_ui/fonts` and `tools/unity-ui-bundle/Assets/Fonts`
- Local changes: none; filename was normalized for launcher and Unity packaging.
- SHA-256: `39c9b64223561f56aaff6062a6f04063c4fc86809ad6768722c06614d977e1cc`
- License text: `packages/launcher_ui/fonts/Quicksand-OFL.txt` (also copied into the Unity UI bundle source)

  This file was previously copied from the Robotopia web bundle
  (`https://robotopia.gg/assets/Quicksand-VariableFont_wght-DE2wFU7n.ttf`, SHA-256
  `8b3a3842cc4b666fde454446e28d1bacde30a0ac861e90cbb0bd77b02ecb9dae`). That copy was not
  byte-identical to upstream, so both bundled copies were replaced with the Google Fonts release
  above to give the font a verifiable first-hand provenance.

TopiaForge bundles the Audiowide font for display typography in the launcher UI and Unity brand bundle.

- Project: Audiowide
- Source files: `https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/audiowide/Audiowide-Regular.ttf`, `https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/audiowide/OFL.txt`
- Upstream: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Audiowide
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1
- Bundled at: `packages/launcher_ui/fonts` and `tools/unity-ui-bundle/Assets/Fonts`
- Local changes: none known; filename was normalized for launcher and Unity packaging.
- SHA-256: `c7c0f2b0f6fad8c623e31772ce79f94a4edb9321ffce9fce978ea892d20ae730`

TopiaForge redistributes Unity's TextMesh Pro essential resources inside the Unity UI bundle source at
`tools/unity-ui-bundle/Assets/TextMesh Pro`, and the release archives carry that directory. The set
comprises shaders, materials, style sheets, line-breaking data, and the Liberation Sans font.

- Project: TextMesh Pro essential resources (Unity Technologies)
- Bundled at: `tools/unity-ui-bundle/Assets/TextMesh Pro`
- License: distributed under the Unity Companion License as part of the Unity Editor package.
- Local changes: the EmojiOne sprite sheet and its sprite asset were removed because their bundled
  attribution granted no redistribution right; the TMP default sprite asset is cleared and emoji
  support disabled accordingly.

- Project: Liberation Sans
- Bundled at: `tools/unity-ui-bundle/Assets/TextMesh Pro/Fonts/LiberationSans.ttf`
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1
- License text: `tools/unity-ui-bundle/Assets/TextMesh Pro/Fonts/LiberationSans - OFL.txt`
- Local changes: none; redistributed as shipped with TextMesh Pro.
- SHA-256: `e5b0af421ea2bfbc1ac8d251d647268087ae82786234c57f757d1f0b90fa8b49`

The standalone `topiaforge` executable embeds the Dart SDK runtime and the following runtime packages. Release
packaging copies the exact license texts resolved by `apps/topiaforge_cli/.dart_tool/package_config.json` into
`third_party/dart/LICENSES`, together with `VERSIONS.json`; package validation fails if any text is absent.

The Flutter 3.44.6 launcher embeds Flutter, Dart, plugins, and package dependencies. Flutter generates the complete
`flutter_assets/NOTICES.Z` notice bundle during each platform build; release validation requires that bundle inside
the shipped launcher.

The self-contained `TopiaForge.GameCompat.Extractor` embeds .NET Runtime 10.0.9. Packaging copies `LICENSE.TXT` and
`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT` from the exact restored `Microsoft.NETCore.App.Runtime.<rid>/10.0.9` runtime pack into
`third_party/dotnet`; validation fails if the runtime version marker or either notice is absent. Public runners pin
.NET SDK 10.0.301 so the runtime pack and its notices cannot drift between release runs.

The extractor also embeds `System.Reflection.MetadataLoadContext` 10.0.9. That NuGet package declares MIT in its
signed `.nuspec` and ships `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT`, but it does not contain a separate `LICENSE.TXT`. Packaging
verifies the exact MIT declaration and copies the identical .NET Foundation MIT text from the pinned runtime pack as
the MetadataLoadContext license, together with the package's exact third-party notices; all are mandatory inputs.

The game-side package validator ships `System.Reflection.Metadata` 10.0.9 and its
`System.Collections.Immutable` 10.0.9 dependency beside the TopiaForge loader.
Both signed NuGet packages declare MIT and record dotnet/dotnet commit
`901ca941248413c79832d2fdbd709da0c4386353`. Release packaging verifies the
exact netstandard2.0 DLL and notice hashes, then emits their license, notices,
and machine-readable provenance under `third_party/dotnet/runtime-loader`.
Robotopia build 2309 supplies the referenced `System.Memory`, `System.Buffers`,
and `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe` assemblies; those player-profile
identities and hashes are validated but their proprietary game copies are not
redistributed.
